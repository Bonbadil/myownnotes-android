Contributing
************

If you want to contribute, you are more than welcome. There is only one thing you should keep in mind:

1. **Always write code in the development branch. The master branch is for package maintainers only. We will not accept pull requests based on the master branch.**

That's it. If you have no idea where to help out:

* check the issues list,
* write a translation,
* proof read code,
* proof read translations

Together we are be able to write a really good application for all of us.


How to submit code
==================
Please take a look at the github documentation: https://help.github.com/categories/63/articles

How to submit translations
==========================

New Translations
----------------
To avoid incomplete translations, new ones need to be pushed to a seperate branch. Please submit an issue and we will add a this branch for you.

Improvements to existing translations
-------------------------------------
If the translation-branch has already been merged, just make the changes in the development branch. If not, use the appropriate language branch. Look at the `network graph`_ to see which one is the case.

Proof read translations
-----------------------
Starting now (July 2014), all new and old translations need to be proof read by at least one other user before being merged into the master branch.
