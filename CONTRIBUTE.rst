If you want to contribute, you are more than welcome. There is only one thing you should keep in mind:

1. **Always write code in the development branch. The master branch is for package maintainers only. We will not accept pull requests based on the master branch.**

That's it. If you have no idea where to help out:

* check the issues list,
* write a translation,
* proof read code,
